The goal of this document is to provide a solid foundation for others wanting to work with the AWS DeepRacer. In addition to that this document also provides information about other possible applications of the AWS DeepRacer, how it can be used in other situations than those intended by Amazon and the limits of these vehicles. Artificial intelligence has been used extensively in robotics, mainly in the form of image and pattern recognition. This allows robots to follow predefined paths or drive to certain areas. While these forms of artificial intelligence have been in use in our robotics lab for some time, the approach which is provided by reinforcement learning has not seen any application. This was mainly due to a lack of fitting equipment and usable software. The recently acquired AWS DeepRacers offer an opportunity to explore the options and applications of reinforcement learning. As there is currently no suitable environment to put them to good use, we were tasked with creating a suitable foundation for others to learn about reinforcement learning. The main part
